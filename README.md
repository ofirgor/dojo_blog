# Dojo Blog - README

## Overview
Dojo Blog is a simple React application created as a learning project to practice and enhance React development skills. The app simulates a basic blog platform where users can view a list of blog posts, read individual blog details, and create new blog posts.

## Features
- **Home:** The landing page of the Dojo Blog app.
- **BlogList:** Displays a list of all blog posts with a brief overview.
- **BlogDetails:** Shows the full details of a selected blog post.
- **Create:** Allows users to create and submit a new blog post.
- **NavBar:** Provides easy navigation between the different sections of the app.
- **NotFound:** basic 404 page.

## How It Works
- Routing: React Router is used to manage navigation between components.
- State Management: The app uses React's built-in state management with useState and useEffect hooks.
- Fetching Data: For this learning project, blog data can be statically defined or fetched from a simple local JSON file.
  
## Future Improvements
- Backend Integration: Connect the app to a backend service for dynamic blog content.
- User Authentication: Add user login and authentication features.
- Styling Enhancements: Improve the UI/UX with advanced styling techniques.
